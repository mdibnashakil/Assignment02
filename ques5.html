                </strong> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                 It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to
                  as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                   Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral 
                   cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability 
                to kill vermin. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.<strong><u>The cat is similar 
                    in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and 
                    retractable claws adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. Its night vision and sense of smell
                     are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, 
                    trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.</u></strong>
